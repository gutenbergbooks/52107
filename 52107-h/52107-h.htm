    <div class="vspace" style="height: 2em"></div>
    <p class="pfirst"><span>If nonsense is to wisdom near allied and truth is often spoken in a jest, which are facts known to very casual observers, there is much more than the passing laugh to be derived from such a collection of anecdote, repartee, and pleasantry as that gathered together in this volume.</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>For some years the</span> <em class="italics">Public Ledger</em> <span>of Philadelphia, and earlier the</span> <em class="italics">Philadelphia Times</em><span>, before the two journals were united, have offered premiums for contributions to a column of jests called "Tales Worth Telling." With the permission of Mr. George W. Ochs of the</span> <em class="italics">Public Ledger</em><span>, the best of these are now collected and published in permanent form for a wider audience in the belief that they will be enjoyed beyond the confines of the newspaper's community and for longer than the day for which it is made and serves its purposes.</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>There is much Americanism in these "Tales." They have the flavor of our soil; the relish of our nationality. While some are plants of foreign growth removed to our atmosphere in which they have taken on a new appearance, there are touches of human nature and character in all of them.</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>If all these anecdotes seem not to be equally laugh-provoking, it is the fate of anecdotes. They are meant for different minds; they have different objects. If any shall teach a lesson, or point a moral while it at the same time fetches a smile, its purpose will not be lost.</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>Such humor, springing, as it does, from the people, much of it being caught at first hands from those who invented it to be transcribed for the newspaper in which it first appeared and now to be preserved in this volume, illustrates many important truths in our American character. Let that not be forgotten! "Show me a nation's humor and I will show you its civilization," is a sentiment worthy to become a proverb. There is hope for the man or the race of men which is gifted with the sense of humor if the mind and lips remain clean and reverent.</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>The Chinese can read this book as well as our occidentals. It can be perused backward or forward and will need no index or table of contents. It can be taken all at once if time and taste call for it, or it may be confidently opened by the skipper and skimmer of books who travels hither and thither and assails his literature only at vulnerable points. It may perhaps be taken up a second time, when, reader, if some of these stories seem to be old friends, you must be certain not to chide and revile this little volume, but compliment yourself upon owning a very retentive mind.</span></p>

    <p class="center pfirst"><span class="bold medium">BEATEN AT HIS OWN GAME</span></p>
    <div class="vspace" style="height: 1em"></div>
    <p class="pfirst"><span>The champion liar of the town was outdoing himself on his pet topic, the Civil War. "Talk of mud," he was saying, "our campaign in the Wilderness was the worst. It rained for days without letting up. When it did stop we started off with our artillery. Soon we came to a regular water hole, but we drove straight along, and do you know that first team went right out of sight."</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>A newcomer then took the floor. "I've seen some mud, too," he said. "When I was a boy, one day after a terribly wet spring, I saw a hat out in the road, right in a big puddle, so I waded out to get it. Maybe now you won't believe me, but there was a man under that hat. Says I, 'Why, hello! can't I help you out?' 'Oh, no,' says he, 'guess I can get along. I'm a-horse back.'"</span></p>
    <div class="vspace" style="height: 3em"></div>
    <p class="center pfirst"><span class="bold medium">THE ABSENT BOY'S FAULT</span></p>
    <div class="vspace" style="height: 1em"></div>
    <p class="pfirst"><span>A certain Sunday-school teacher had a regular set of questions that she asked every Sunday. Beginning with the first boy she would ask, "Who made you?" to which he would reply, "The Lord." Then she would regularly ask the second boy, "Who was the first man?" and he would reply, "Adam."</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>One Sunday the first boy was away, and of course the second boy moved into his place. As usual, the teacher began by asking, "Who made you?"</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>The boy replied, "Adam."</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>"No, that is not right," said the teacher. "The Lord made you."</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>"I guess not," the child replied. "The boy that the Lord made is away to-day."</span></p>
    <div class="vspace" style="height: 3em"></div>
    <p class="center pfirst"><span class="bold medium">THE "ONE HORSE" RAILROAD</span></p>
    <div class="vspace" style="height: 1em"></div>
    <p class="pfirst"><span>It was a train of only two cars on a miserable branch railroad, and was jogging along at a distressingly low rate of speed when all of a sudden it came to a dead stop. One of the passengers, whose patience had become exhausted, asked a brakeman the cause of delay.</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>"There's a herd of cows on the track," he answered.</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>In about ten minutes the train got under way again, jerking along convulsively for about a mile or two, when it came to a halt. An old man sitting near the door turned to the brakeman, who was plainly annoyed by the many questions, and said irritably:</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>"What in thunder is the matter, anyhow?"</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>"Why, we've caught up to the cows again!" the brakeman answered.</span></p>

    <p class="center pfirst"><span class="bold medium">A POSTSCRIPT</span></p>
    <div class="vspace" style="height: 1em"></div>
    <p class="pfirst"><span>The editor of a rural paper visited a large city just after the shooting of Mr. McKinley and took great interest in the newspaper bulletins informing the public of the president's condition. Shortly after the editor's return home, Deacon Jones was taken seriously ill, and the following bulletins were promptly posted:</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>10.00 A.M--Deacon Jones no better. ll.00 A.M.--Deacon Jones has relapse. 12.30 P.M.--Deacon Jones weaker. Pulse failing. 2.15 P.M.--Deacon Jones's family summoned. 3.10 P.M--Deacon Jones has died and gone to Heaven.</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>Later in the afternoon a traveling salesman happened by, stopped to read the bulletins, and, going to the board, added:</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>4.10 P.M.--Great excitement in Heaven; Deacon Jones has not yet arrived. The worst is feared.</span></p>
    <div class="vspace" style="height: 3em"></div>
    <p class="center pfirst"><span class="bold medium">HOW COULD HE KNOW</span></p>
    <div class="vspace" style="height: 1em"></div>
    <p class="pfirst"><span>Jim Murphy had been accused of selling liquor illicitly and the prosecuting attorney was endeavoring to make Pat, a job teamster, admit that he had delivered liquor to the defendant. He stated that he had once delivered freight to Murphy and that part of that freight was a barrel, but when asked what the barrel contained he replied that he did not know.</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>"Don't know! Wasn't the barrel marked?" asked the attorney.</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>"Yis, sor."</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>"Then how dare you tell the court that you don't know what was in it?"</span></p>
    <p class="pnext"><span>"Because, sor, the barrel was marked 'Jim Murphy' on one end and 'Bourbon Whiskey' on the other. How the divil did I know which was in it?"</span></p>
